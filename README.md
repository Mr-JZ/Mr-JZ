# Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Jan Zisenis

## Student

I am currently working on a personal project centered around shopping planning, utilizing Flutter and Supabase. My initial focus was on Embedded development, but I've discovered a growing interest in full-stack development. This led me to create an API using FastAPI, and I've also explored Quarkus in Java. My passion for bringing ideas to life began at the age of 16, which is when I started programming. This journey has included creating and printing 3D models with a 3D printer. I find great fulfillment in the process of automation and ensuring the smooth operation of final products. Additionally, I have found that using Docker containers for backend development simplifies setup and usage.
